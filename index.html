        <p><strong>Situation:</strong>In professional sports, many athletes exceed their own limits when under pressure. Performances under these immense pressure are called the "clutch." 
        This project aims to analyze professional basketball players in the NBA 2024-2025 regular season who performs the best in the clutch. </p>
        <p><strong>Task:</strong>Analyze data from the NBA 2024-2025 season and determine who has the highest trueshooting percentage and points scored in the last 5 minutes and when the points differential is at 5 or less.  </p>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong>Extracted data from all NBA players using the NBA.com APIs using Visual Studio Code and written in Python. Exported to a .CSV file for import into PowerBI. Used Power Query in PowerBI to clean data and transform data. 
        Many players are filtered out due to not meeting the threshold for certain statistics such as shots taken in the clutch, total minutes played in the clutch in a season, etc. The dashboard includes a scatter plot that with the x and y-axis for pts and trueshooting percentange, respectively. 
        The more a player is closer to the top, right corner of the scatter plot, indicates the more points and efficient they are in the clutch.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong>The three most clutch players in based on the data were 1. Jalen Brunson, Tyrese Maxey, and Nikola Jokic. </p>
        <p><strong>Tools:</strong>Visual Studio Code, Python, PowerBI </p>
